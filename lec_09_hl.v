(** ** Recap 

  - Last time we looked at the IMP programming language which introduced the
    concept of programming with state.
  - Thus we got a "language" for programming TMs.
  - We then introduced it's small-step (machine-like) and
    big-step (evaluation) semantics. These different styles of giving semantics:
    small-step and big-step semantics.
  - We did a formal proof that big-step evaluation was deterministic.
  - Today we will introduce _Hoare Logic_.
  - Along the way we will see a 3rd style of semantics: _axiomatic semantics_.
  - Finally we'll show how to verify programs.
 
 *)

(** ** Goal for today

   - Introduce Hoare logic, including assertions and compositional rules
     (assignment, pre/post, skip, seq, if, while).
   - Introduce axiomatic semantics.
   - Show example program verifications with _decorated commands_.
   - Show how to extract verification conditions in an effort to automate
     verification.

 *)


(** ** Hoare Logic *)

(**
   - Up until now, we've proven properties of entire languages / machines.
   - What if we wanted to prove a property of a single program in a language?
   - This is where *Hoare Logic* comes in. Hoare Logic is a logic that is designed
     to prove properties of programs.
   - Hoare Logic (and separation logic) is an active area of research.
 *)



(** *** The Basic Idea 1: Make assertions *)
(*

   {{P}} c {{Q}}
*)

(** 
   - P is a *precondition*, i.e., true before we run c
   - c is a command in IMP or a program/algorithm
   - Q is a *postcondition*, i.e., true after we run c
 *)


(** *** The Basic Idea 2: Compositional *)
(*

    {{P}} c1 {{Q}}  {{Q}} c2 {{R}}
   -------------------------------- HoareSeq
          {{P}} c1; c2 {{R}}
*)

(**
   - For every construct in our language, we will have a corresponding set of 
     assertions that we can make about it.
   - In this manner, we can prove properties of programs by following the structure
     of the program.
   - 
 *)


(** *** So we need to define two things

   - an assertion language
   - structural proof rules
 *)


(** ** Assertions 

   - First we need to be able to make *assertions* about programs.
   - What could we possibly say about an IMP program?
   - Well IMP programs take states and transform them into states.
   - So perhaps we can make assertions about states.
 *)

Definition Assertion := state -> Prop.


(** *** Example 1
   
   [st X <= st Y]

   The valued stored at identifer X is less than the value stored at identifier Y.
 *)
Definition assn1 : Assertion :=
  fun st => st X <= st Y.


(** *** Example 2
   
   [st X = 3 \/ st X <= st Y]

   The valued stored at identifer X is either 3 or
   the value stored at identifier X is less than the value stored at identifier Y.
 *)
Definition assn2 : Assertion :=
  fun st => st X = 3 \/ st X <= st Y.


(**
   - Thus we have a shallow embedding!
   - We could have a deep embedding if we reified the language of propositions
     for Hoare logic as an AST. But this would be a lot of work.
   - In this case it is simpler to do a shallow embedding.
   - The downside of a shallow embedding is that now we have the power of [Prop].
 *)


(** *** Example 3
   
   [st X = 3 -> st Y = 4]

   If the value stored at X is 3 then the value stored at Y is 4.
 *)
Definition assn3 : Assertion :=
  fun st => (fun st => st X = 3) st -> (fun st => st Y = 4) st.


(** ** Example 4
   
   [st X = 3 <-> st Y = 4]

   If the value stored at X is 3 iff the value stored at Y is 4.
 *)
Definition assn4 : Assertion :=
  fun st => (fun st => st X = 3) st <-> (fun st => st Y = 4) st.


(** *** Ignore me, notation for pretty assertions *)

(** *** Side Comment:
   - When working with shallow embeddings, it is useful to have powerful
     notation mechanisms.
   - In this case, we are going to use notation to make the shallowly-embedded
     assertion language as close to Coq's original syntax as possible.

   - Upon first glance, this rule looks backwards.
   - If Q holds and I assign a to X, shouldn't the postcondition be
     Q with [X |-> a]?
   - As we saw with HoareAsgnWrong, this can't possibly hold because
     it doesn't hold when Q = True.
   - So let's reason backwards with what the rule is saying.

(** ** Decorated Commands *)

(** *** Extracting Verification Conditions *)

     without changing the meaning of the program.
   - We can write a function that gets rid of all the decorations.

  | DCPre _ d => erase d
  | DCPost d _ => erase d
  end.

Definition erase_dec (dec : decorated) : com :=
  match dec with
  | Decorated P d => erase d
  end.


(**
   - Here is the previous reduce to 0 example.
   - We have decorated it with all the intermediate propositions and shown
     that erasing the decorations gets us back the original program.

(** *** Verification Conditions *)

(**
   - Now for the real reason why we want decorated programs.
   - We can use our compositional proof-rules to construct an entire predicate
     that must be true of our entire program, the **verification conditions**.
   - This will enable us to automate proving properties of our programs.

(** ** Summary 

   - We saw Hoare logic, including assertions and compositional rules
     (assignment, pre/post, skip, seq, if, while).
   - This gave us a third style of semantics: axiomatic semantics.
   - We saw example verifications of single programs.
   - Finally we saw how to extract verification conditions.
